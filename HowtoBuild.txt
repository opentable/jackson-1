This is a pre maven project. So it's a bit tricky

Step 1: Build the JARS

1. CRITICAL: Change impl_version in build.xml 

(add another 9 to end for each version. So 1.9.9 originally, then 1.9.99, 1.9.999, etc)
(This way we keep it as high as possible, but don't change version numbers to 2.x)

2. Install ant (brew install ant on a mac)
3. run "ant all".
4. Verify Files appear in build

-  we care about jackson-mapper-asl-<version>.jar and jackson-core-asl-<version>.jar

STEP 2: Deploy

1. Go to the mavenize directory
2. type "./try.sh <version>"

CRITICAL: Must be same version as specified in STEP 1. There is very little error checking

3. Version will be restamped on the two dummy poms.
4. JARS will be copied from ../build
5. Jars and POM will be deployed to artifactory


STEP 3: Test!

Test the code. Do the new dependencies resolve. Does everything work

STEP 4: Update Parent POM
